# PyPackage-Installer
A python script that will install all required packages from code into the python interpreter it was run on. Useful for releasing unpackaged code.

# Instructions
Simply place all required python packages you would like to install inside *requirements.txt*.

When you want to install, just run *install_requirements.py* or import the module:
```python
import install_requirements
```
If you manually want to install packages go to your bash/terminal and run the command *pip install -r requirements.txt*
